Here, in this lab part, we will look into 2 use cases where a WAF can bring a lot of value.

S3 Metadata headers are often underlooked and not inspected because their role is to offer descriptive labels on the objects they are transported with. By default they are not processed and their role is for classification only.

In fact they are more used that what everyone thinks and could be a huge attack vector for several attacks. We are going through 2 of them in the two following labs:
- [Metadata Poisoning](./metadata_poisoning.md)  <WIP>
- [Stored XSS](./stored_xss.md)

These are just two examples to remind that **security is key** because S3 objects, and particularly in AI enabled environments, can carry critical data sets.
